            NEW.order = (
              SELECT MAX("order")
              FROM tabloid_section_products
              WHERE tabloid_section_id = new.tabloid_section_id
            );

          RETURN NEW;
        TRIGGERSQL
    end
  end

  def down
    remove_trigger(:tabloid_section_products, :increase_order)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
